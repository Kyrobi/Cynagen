## Chunk Resetting
Every 12 months (interval subjected to change), chunks will be selectively reset. What this means is that any chunks that have been loaded for **less than** 45 minutes will be reset. Claiming an area will not keep the area from being reset if the chunks have been loaded for **less than** 45 minutes. The chunk loade time is a one-time thing. Once a chunk as been loaded for a total of 45 minutes, it will always be there. You do not have to come on every X period to load the chunk again for 45 minutes. 


## Claims Resest
Claims do **NOT** automatically reset. However, within reason, a claim can be requested for removal if the owner of the claim has not been active for **ATLEAST** 90 days.
