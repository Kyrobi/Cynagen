## Chunk Resetting
Every 6 months (interval subjected to change), chunks will be selectively reset. What this means is that any chunks that have been loaded for [b]less than[/b] 30 minutes will be reset. Claiming an area will not keep the area from being reset if the chunks have been loaded for [b]less than[/b] 30 minutes.


## Claims Resest
Claims do [b]NOT[/b] automatically reset. However, within reason, a claim can be requested for removal if the owner of the claim has not been active for [b]ATLEAST[/b] 90 days.
