## Chunk Resetting
Every 12 months (interval subjected to change), chunks will be selectively reset. What this means is that any chunks that have been loaded for **less than** 30 minutes will be reset. Claiming an area will not keep the area from being reset if the chunks have been loaded for **less than** 30 minutes.


## Claims Resest
Claims do **NOT** automatically reset. However, within reason, a claim can be requested for removal if the owner of the claim has not been active for **ATLEAST** 90 days.


## McMMO
- Double drops for McMMO are disabled.
- Most of the skills have been nerfed. Some are more heavily nerfed than others.
- Each still caps out at level 1000.
- McMMO repair block: **Emerald Block.**    McMMO salvage block: **Diamond Block**
