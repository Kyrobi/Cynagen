## The Beginning
**June 4, 2017**<br>
The server has officially been made open to the public, anyone can now join the server. This was also near the time when I was inspired and motivated by another server owner and decided to make my own server (open to public).

**March 17, 2015**<br>
The server was officially created. This was created so that I could play with my friends.



## The War
**Febuarary 2018**<br>
Many people were dissapointed in the fact that the server was shutting down. However, I decided to give the server to a person named Fixerboy and let him host the server. For things did not turn out well. First, he had a different idea on how the server will move forward. Due to this, many people that went to the server hosted by Fixerboy were not happy. To protest, the Cynagen members decided to build lag machines, trolling, and griefing to get the point across. Things were looking tense.

**Febuarary 22, 2018**<br>
Nearing the final day until the server shuts down. Due to the insane amount of stress that I wasn't expecting when going into this, I decided to shut down the server when the month is over.




## The Secret Month
**Last few days of March 2018**<br>
I decided that it's time to bring the server back again. The Cynagen that Fixerboy owned didn't end well and the friends that were on the private server are no longer active. This is an attempt to bring back everything that was lost.

**Mid to late March 2018**<br>
The twenty or so players that were invited onto the private server became less and less active. It came to a point where no one would be online anymore.

**March 1, 2018**<br>
Due to the original Cynagen shutting down, I decided to make a private server to have a select few on Cynagen to play on it. It was just a small vanilla server with custom terrain generation.




## The War II
**March 1, 2018**<br>
A major Cynagen player, GamerFishy, eventually gained Moderator status on Fixerboy's version of Cynagen. GamerFishy wanted to be a Moderator on the actual Cynagen when it was still up. Now that she's a Moderator, she dedcided to stay on Fixerboy's server. The rest of the Cynagen members saw this as a betrayal. The fact that she abandoned all of the other players just so she could be a staff on the other Cynagen.

Due to this, members of Cynagen decided to go on Fixerboy's server and cause mayhem. Weeks later, GamerFishy officially hates all the Cynagen member, include the server in it's entirety. She thinks that the server is racist, homophobic, and ablist. In retaliation, the members of Cynagen also began to despise her more.

## The Rat War 
**Late May 2021**<br>
Source: TheK1ngg (or at the time: JayCohBeh)
The fourth great rat war (or which some argue is a continuation of the third great rat war with a cease fire) as a server war between the two largest factions of early 2021, The Rats, and later the Anti Rats (who were originally formed due to whoopy's obsession with rats). The war begun with fights in the pvp zone before both sides used designated battle grounds (roughly 7 battles, only one victory going to the anti rats). The Anti Rats, were struggling and so they decided to pool together resources and create one mega base while still using WoW's home as their HQ. The Anti Rats, were not very nice (sugarcoating it) on discord, in their conversations on discord, they had accidently woken up some of the sleeping giants of the server, one of which was JayCohBeh who wasn't very happy being pulled into this war. JayCohBeh was originally neutral while giving supplies to the Rats inbetween his classes and when he had free time. While Jay was at Barrel's XP farm, 2 of the Anti Rats jumped him. A lengthy and "civil" conversation ensured in chat after the two Anti Rats were slain. This brought Jay out of "hibernation". With the help of Jean and Whoopy, Jay prepared to end the war and take matters into his own hands. In 48 hours, Jay had stacks of Wither Skulls, End Crystals, TNT and double chests and shulkers full of xp potions to heal gear mid battle and normal potions to replenish mid fight if needed. The day of the final battle finally came. Waiting in the anti rats base with invis pots, Jay waited until all but WoW had left the base. Jay then begun his carnage as the Seven Anti Rats who were online went back to the mega base in horror to find it surrounded by Withers, End Crystals and to see their friends dead in chat. This went on for 20 minutes until finally Jay was killed at the hands of WoW, however it was too late at that point. The Fun Police (staff) were already online and the base (what wasnt claimed) was practically swiss cheese. The Anti Rats unwilling were forced to surrender, The rats had won. However not everything ended in sunshine and rainbows for the rats. JayCohBeh was banned for two weeks for "war crimes" (which I still deny) by Caliteo. There is some controversy still surrounding the conclusion of the Fourth War, there remains some bad blood between the parties.
