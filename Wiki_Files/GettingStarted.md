### Get Started

This will cover some basic things that you'll need to get started.

## Introduction

This is a small server for people who are interested in that. A small server with what seems to by a nice community and helpful people (mostly).

Starting out the server might be complicated for some people, so continue on reading and see what to do.


## The First Step

Once you have join the server, you might want to find an area to start building. To do this, you can either walk out from spawn or issue the command /wild.

Or you know, reading the rules might also be very important. Issue the command /rules.


## Teleporting

Teleport commands are also available if you wish to teleport to someone.

Use /tpa (username) to request a teleport to a specific person.

Use /tpahere (username) to request someone to teleport to you.

Once the request is sent, the other person has 120 seconds to accept the teleportation request.


## Claiming land

After you have found an area you want to build, start building. It is important to claim your land to prevent people from griefing your build. To access the tool, you can either do /kit claim or craft a golden shovel.


## Keep Inventory

You don't have to worry much about dying since keep inventory is enabled in the overworld and only in the overworld.



After you feel comfortable getting the very basics of the server, you may proceed to doing more advanced stuff on the server.



### More advanced stuff


## Money

There are a couple of ways to earn money on the server.

1. [Voting.](https://topg.org/Minecraft/in-488463) You can get $200 each time you vote. Command: /vote

2. Selling items on market. You can sell items and hope that players buy them. Make sure you collect your money from the market.


## Market

This is a player-ran market on the server. You can access it by /market. You can put items up for sale or buy from other players.

/market my to view your sold items and collect money.

/market publish to put items onto the market for sale.

Note:

You won't be able to see your own published items on the market.

There is a 5% seller's tax.



### ## Even more advanced stuff


You'll have to figure it out on your own.
